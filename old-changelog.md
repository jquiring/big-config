This changelog is **deprecated**. Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/natesilva/big-config/releases) on Github.

## 2.0.0 (2019-07-15)

- Node 10 is now the minimum supported version.
- Updated dependencies.

## 1.10.0 (2019-04-03)

- Dependency updates.

## 1.6.0 (2018-03-22)

- YAML configuration files are now supported. Use file extension `.yaml`.

## 1.5.0 (2017-09-27)

- You can now load JSON files that contain comments.

## 1.4.0 (2017-09-06)

- The `deasync` dependency, needed for S3 only, is never loaded unless you attempt to load configuration from S3. This dependency requires a binary component which may not be available on all platforms, notably AWS Lambda. As long as you donâ€™t use S3 configurations, `big-config` should now work on those platforms.
